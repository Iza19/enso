/** A GUI-friendly structure describing expression with nodes mapped to
  * expression text spans.
  *
  * SpanTree flattens nested applications into flat children lists and describes
  * possible actions, i.e. which nodes can be replaced when creating a
  * connection or where a new variable can be inserted.
  *
  * It is expected that this structure facilitates, with possible help of
  * additional layers, the following GUI parts:
  *  - expression editor and its behavior when creating a connection
  *  - node inputs
  *  - node outputs
  *
  * This structure can be considered a layer over AST that does not introduce
  * any new data, it just presents AST in more accessible form.
